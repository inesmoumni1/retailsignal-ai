# 🚀 RetailSignal AI - Sales Intelligence MVP

**RetailSignal AI** is a "Sales Intelligence Layer" prototype designed to empower Account Managers (AMs) by bridging the gap between raw market signals and high-impact client narratives.

### 💡 The Vision
The challenge for AMs isn't the lack of data, but the **speed of transformation** from search signals into actionable business opportunities. This dashboard automates the analysis of Google Trends for the "Mid-Market Sustainable E-commerce" segment and generates ROI-focused sales strategies.

### 🎯 Use Case: Sustainable Skincare (France Market)
The MVP focuses on three critical scenarios tailored for the French ecosystem:

1.  **Zero-Plastic Surge:** Capitalizing on the rise of solid skincare (Focus: LTV & AOV).
2.  **Early Sun-Care:** Capturing mineral SPF intent as early as April (Focus: CPC Arbitrage).
3.  **Brand Defense:** Protecting market share against "Clean Beauty" competitors.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React.js (Vite)
- **Data Viz:** Recharts (Dynamic charting)
- **Icons:** Lucide-React
- **Deployment:** Vercel

### 🧠 Embedded Business Logic
- **Sales Battlecards:** Integrated objection handling (CPA vs. LTV).
- **Strategic Budgeting:** Step-by-step recommendations (Test > Scale > Full Funnel).
- **Product Mix:** Emphasizing Performance Max (PMax) and Demand Gen adoption.
